Or why they so easily bear high-quality produce?$0#$b#That's because of the meteor shower! The soil in the valley is extremely fertile. It has an abundance of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium!$1#$b#There's also a high concentration of minerals present in the soil, including zinc, manganese, boron, iron, sulfur, cobalt, copper, magnesium and so on.$0#$b#You can grow just about anything with ease thanks to the fertile soil. It's the reason so many farmers have established their livelihood in Stardew Valley!$1",
